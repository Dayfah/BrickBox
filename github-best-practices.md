# GitHub Best Practices

## Add Topics
Adding relevant topics (e.g., comics, vault, collection, Python, etc.) helps improve discoverability on GitHub.

## Enable GitHub Discussions
Enabling Discussions allows your community to ask questions, share ideas, and provide feedback in an organized way.

## Improve Documentation:
- Ensure your README provides clear setup instructions, feature overviews, and contribution guidelines.
- Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md and a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
- If you have an API, add API documentation or usage examples.

## Issue and PR Templates
Add issue and pull request templates to standardize contributions and bug reports.

## Branch Protections
Enable branch protection rules for the main branch to help ensure required reviews and passing checks before merges.

## Add Tests and CI/CD
If not already present, implement automated tests and configure CI/CD (for example, using GitHub Actions) to ensure code quality on every commit and PR.

## Wiki or Project Board
Use the Wiki for in-depth documentation or a Project Board to manage features and bugs.

## Badges
Add badges (for build status, license, coverage, etc.) to the README for quick information at a glance.

## Increase Community Engagement
Encourage stars, forks, and contributions by including a call-to-action in your README.
