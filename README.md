# BrickBox
BrickBox is the modern vault for comic collectors—track runs, tag keys, map continuity, and watch market moves without losing the culture.

## Design Theme
The visual identity uses the base64-encoded icon in `assets/brickbox-icon.b64`. Generate the PNG with `python scripts/decode_icon.py` (or `base64 -d assets/brickbox-icon.b64 > assets/brickbox-icon.png`) and apply the theme’s dark slate background `#111419`, brick red accents `#6A2A29`, and light ivory text `#F5E9D5`.
